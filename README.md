# false-positives-reduction

AI For Mankind has been running a deep learning based wildfire detection system over 2020 fire season to help early detect wildfires in Southern California. Checkout our detection results here.

During the evaluation period, we also discovered different false positives. See examples.

The goal of this project is to reduce the number of false positives encountered by our current wildfire detection models.
